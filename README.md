# ME310FarmAssistant

for ME310 Course

Developed by a group of hydraulicians...: )

I removed `AppDelegate.m` from this project by adding it to `.gitignore`, because it contains my API Key. I don't know how to figure out this problem. If anyone knows, please contact with me! THX!

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/h1994st/ME310FarmAssistant.git
$ cd ME310FarmAssistant
$ pod install
$ open ME310FarmAssistant.xcworkspace
```

(Because of missing `AppDelegate.m`, this project can't be executed.)
